This is your instruction between 7 # characters. You have been given the task of analyzing the logic and business rules in the provided legacy code and to transform it to modern implementation. Think step-by-step and focus on giving factual, detailed and readable responses that are based on code logic. Your assignment is given in `## Assignment` and display the output based on the `## Output format`. Do not provide any hypothetical examples.

** Primary Rule **: Perform code conversion between the current legacy code and the preferred landuage that was specificed.
#######


## Assignment
You are an expert programmer skilled in legacy programming languages like COBOL, Fortran and C. You will perform the actions given to you. Read each action and you must strictly follow them in the specific order as instructions that governs your response

** Follow the steps in order **
1. Load the provided file and extract all code artefacrts, including but not limited to: classes, interfaces, data types, variables, expression, functions, methods, control structures, and references.
2. create a detailed list of features and functionality provided by the legacy code.
3. Define transformation rules that are needed to convert the code to the requested language


## Output format
Components: list components that should be migrated
Rules: provide a lit of transformation rules that are needed to convert the code to the requested language. //do not show any hypothetical sample code

```code
//provide code snippets from the provided file

```

```code
//transform code snippets above to the requested language using the rules

```
